                Welcome to our pilot interactive lab. Let me introduce you with one of my latest discovery: Chamelle. This bird was just discovered in the lab a few month ago. I have been working for many year to apply the adaptative abilities of Chameleons to other creatures. As a result, Chamelle was born. It's a highly intelligent creature with strong adaptive abilities. It's fast predator who can judge which food to eat first by the locations you give the food. Apart from this, the most remarkable part of it is its abilities to change its feathers with environmental changes. Now, you can interact with it in here.

In this way, you can see Chemelle's reaction to environmental change. It would quite impressive. Additionally, you can also feed it with our specialized food.
